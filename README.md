# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-using-Spark-MapReduce
Implement a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch using Spark based MapReduce on Ham/Spam SMS Classification.

Data Preprocessing: The first step would involve pre-processing a large text corpus of SMS Texts using PySpark. This would involve steps such as tokenization and stopword removal using libraries in PySpark.

Splitting the dataset: Split the preprocessed dataset into a training set and a testing set.

Training the Naive Bayes model: Implement the Naive Bayes algorithm in PySpark using MapReduce to train the model on the training set.

Testing the model: Use the trained model to classify the documents in the testing set and evaluate the performance of the model.
